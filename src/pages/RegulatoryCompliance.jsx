                            <p>Escrowly protects itself from financial crime risks through an advanced AML/KYC compliance system that follows these steps:</p>
                            <h4>4.1 Customer Identification Program (CIP)</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>a. Users must conduct identity verification prior to beginning any escrow process. This requirement applies to everyone at Escrowly.</li>

                                <li>c. The company performs continuous transaction surveillance to detect abnormal behaviors.</li>
                            </ul>
