                                <h3>What is Real Estate Escrow?</h3>
                                <p>A real estate escrow is a financial arrangement where a neutral third party, like Escrowly, holds and regulates the payment of funds required for a property transaction. It ensures that the buyer and seller fulfill their respective obligations before money changes hands.</p>
                                <p>With Escrowly’s blockchain escrow service, real estate buyers and sellers can complete deals without fear of fraud, payment delays, or manipulation. And since crypto payments are irreversible, using secure P2P crypto escrow is not just smart - it is necessary.</p>
