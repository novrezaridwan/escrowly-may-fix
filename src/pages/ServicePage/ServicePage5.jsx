                                <h3>What Are Online Goods and Digital Items?</h3>

                                <h3>Why Crypto Escrow for Digital Transactions?</h3>
                                <p>When buyers receive online goods through a sale there is no process available for returning them if payment issues arise. The permanent nature of cryptocurrency payments together with unchangeable transactions creates dangerous conditions for people transacting through this system.</p>
                                <p>Escrowly solves this problem with the following characteristics:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Users can place crypto assets under secure escrow services</li>
                                    <li>The system delivers funds only when the customer expresses satisfaction</li>
                                    <li>The platform includes automated solutions to handle disputes between parties</li>
                                    <li>Stablecoins USDT and USDC provide price stability to maintain financial equilibrium</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>Every transaction benefit from trust-based security through a structure which operates without requiring conventional fiat currency systems.</p>
                                <h3>How Escrowly Safeguards Online Goods & Digital Item Exchanges</h3>
                                <h6>1. Safe Payment Handling with Stablecoins</h6>
                                <p>The platform uses only USDT and USDC stablecoins since they ensure users stay protected from cryptocurrency market value movements. For example, the protection offered by Escrowly ensures payments worth $500 will remain at that value until the delivery service completes. The start of every transaction enables both sides to establish value within secure terms before they carry on with confidence.</p>
                                <h6>2. Customizable Escrow Agreements</h6>
                                <p>Every deal is unique. Escrowly gives buyers and sellers full control to establish all necessary terms in advance that include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Deliverables</li>
                                    <li>Timeline</li>
                                    <li>Acceptance criteria</li>
                                    <li>Payment release conditions</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The conditions for any crypto exchange are established by parties as part of their original transaction agreement.</p>
                                <h6>3. Dispute Resolution</h6>
                                <p>The agreement contains ways to file disputes when delivery terms do not match the original agreement. The expert mediators from Escrowly evaluate the following pieces of evidence during dispute resolution:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Screenshots</li>
                                    <li>Delivery records</li>
                                    <li>Email communications</li>
                                    <li>Service reports</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Therefore, an unbiased conclusion can be achieved through factual evidence rather than subjective emotional and biased influences.</p>
