                                <h2>Domain Name Escrow With Escrowly</h2>
                                <h3>Why Use Escrowly for Domain Name Escrow?</h3>
                                <p>The market for domain names continues to evolve at an alarming rate. Premium domain names carry extreme value that ranges from several thousand dollars up to millions of dollars. However, crypto transactions are a double-edged sword because they are permanent, yet they are vulnerable to fraudulent activities. Therefore, the solution for business domain transactions is Escrowly’s crypto escrow service.</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>During domain transfer procedures, funds stay locked in place at all times.</li>
                                    <li>The system ensures full commitment by all involved parties to their contractual agreements.</li>
                                    <li>Escrowly enables users to receive instant payments through USDT or USDC.</li>
                                    <li>Businesses can defend themselves from fraud using blockchain-validated receipts along with other verifiable features.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>Secure crypto transactions provided by Escrowly protect all parties, whether you are establishing startups, investing in domain flips, or mediating deals between online businesses.</p>
                                <h3>How Domain Escrow with Escrowly Works</h3>
                                <h6>1. Agreement</h6>
                                <p>The parties involved confirm both the price amount and the conditions of the domain purchase. Broker participation is optional.</p>
                                <h6>2. Deposit Funds</h6>
                                <p>Next, the buyer stores their funds in an escrow wallet for crypto designed by Escrowly. You should note that the available currency options in Escrowly transactions are restricted to USDT and USDC. This helps to eliminate the volatility associated with other cryptocurrencies and reduce fluctuations in the value of your digital assets.</p>
                                <h6>3. Transfer Domain</h6>
                                <p>When the transaction is complete, the domain name is transferred officially from the seller to the buyer. Afterwards, Escrowly verifies the completion of the transfer.</p>
                                <h6>4. Disbursement</h6>
                                <p>The seller receives payment from the previously deposited funds after the buyer successfully receives the item or completes the inspection period.</p>
                                <h3>What Makes Escrowly Unique?</h3>
                                <p>The existing escrow providers operate on different systems, but Escrowly introduces a complete crypto-oriented solution that did not exist before.</p>
                                <p>Escrowly is:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Crypto-first: No fiat, no banks. Just secure P2P crypto escrow.</li>
                                    <li>The platform provides security through stablecoins, which include only USDT and USDC to maintain price stability.</li>
                                    <li>The platform is officially registered as a Verified Money Services Business by FinCEN in accordance with U.S. regulations.</li>
                                    <li>Escrowly uses escrow smart contract crypto technology with customizable features to offer trustless operations.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>Escrowly harnesses a premium set of features best suited for domain transactions in the crypto economy, particularly when handling important or cross-border crypto escrow transactions.</p>
                                <h3>Why Only USDT and USDC?</h3>
                                <p>At Escrowly, we have made a conscious choice: no Bitcoin, no Ethereum, no volatile coins. Here’s why we only support USDT and USDC:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Price Stability: Volatility is the enemy of fair value. With stablecoins pegged to the US Dollar, both parties lock in a clear, consistent value.</li>
                                    <li>Fast Transactions: Unlike ETH or BTC with variable gas fees and slow confirmations, USDT/USDC offer fast, low-cost transactions.</li>
                                    <li>Reduced Risk for Sellers: Sellers don’t need to worry about a sudden dip in value between when the buyer pays and when the domain is transferred.</li>
                                    <li>Greater Adoption: USDT and USDC are widely accepted across wallets, exchanges, and DeFi platforms, offering liquidity on demand.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p className="note">In a world where crypto payments are irreversible, stablecoins provide the clarity, speed, and control that make escrow for crypto not just safer, but smarter.</p>
                                <h3>Broker Support for Complex Domain Sales</h3>
                                <p>Does your deal involve a domain broker? Escrowly provides broker escrow services through which brokers can receive secure commission payments. Brokers can:</p>

                                    <li>View transaction progress</li>

                                </ol>
                                <p>This structure is ideal for:</p>
                                <ol>
