                                        <p>Escrowly recognizes the necessity for complete agreement between all parties prior to money transactions. Every transaction at Escrowly.com includes an inspection period that provides sufficient time for both buyers and sellers to confirm the successful delivery of goods or services. Whether you are seeking a secure P2P crypto escrow purchase or escrow for industrial equipment, Escrowly allows you to inspect, and approve.</p>
                                        <h3>What Is the Inspection Period?</h3>
                                        <p>During the inspection period, buyers have the ability to check and verify that the delivered product satisfies their agreed specifications. Payment from the escrow wallet will be released to the seller only after the approving buyer warrants everything is in order.</p>
                                        <p>The inspection period ensures secure crypto transactions and stops both parties from being rushed, especially in cases where trust is vital such as crypto escrow for businesses, crypto escrow for online, escrow for second-hand car sales, and many others.</p>

                                        <h3>How It Works?</h3>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>1. The transaction starts with the seller and the buyer establishing terms. Subsequently, the buyer makes a deposit to the crypto escrow platform.</li>
                                            <li>2. The seller transfers the goods or services to meet the conditions outlined in the agreement.</li>
                                            <li>3. The inspection period begins when the buyer performs checks to confirm the quality and performance or authenticity of the goods.</li>
                                            <li>4. The transaction reaches its end when the buyer chooses to release funds following their approval. The dispute resolution team from Escrowly will intervene when buyers do not approve the transaction.</li>
                                        </ol>
                                        <p>Enterprises using decentralized escrow services and escrow for business acquisition benefit from this basic process, which delivers equilibrium and unbiased treatment to the deals.</p>
                                        <img className="w-full h-auto my-4 rounded-lg" src="/images/escrowly-inspection-period2.webp" alt="Escrowly Inspetion Period More"/>
                                        <blockquote>Crypto payments have an irreversible nature, which makes the inspection period one of the maximum protection layers for sellers and buyers</blockquote>
                                        <h3>What if the Buyer Does Not Click on “Confirm Receipt”?</h3>
                                        <p>If the buyer does not click on “Confirm Receipt” the payment will still be automatically released to the seller at the end of the inspection period agreed upon when the deal was opened.</p>
                                        <h3>Why It Matters in Crypto Deals</h3>
                                        <p>The inspection period reduces risks of fraudulent practices as well as incorrect charges or substandard service in the following cases:</p>

                                        </ul>
