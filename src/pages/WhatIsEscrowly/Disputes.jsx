                                        <h3>How Our Dispute Process Works</h3>
                                        <p>Our process maintains a straightforward and fast system that stays transparent at all times.</p>
                                        <p><strong>1. Initiate the Dispute</strong></p>
                                        <p>Either party may initiate a dispute to address problems that occur during the inspection time. Customers can initiate disputes through the escrow system across various transactions starting from marketplace escrow and including crypto mining rigs escrow.</p>
                                        <p><strong>2. Submit Evidence</strong></p>
                                        <p>The parties can submit documents combined with screenshots and proof consisting of delivery records and smart contract logs, along with supporting documents about the transaction.</p>
                                        <p><strong>3. Escrowly Review</strong></p>
                                        <p>The dispute resolution team at Escrowly conducts a neutral assessment of every submitted piece of evidence. A complete transparent evaluation includes the examination of platform logs, smart contract activity, timestamped material, and blockchain documentation.</p>
                                        <p><strong>4. Final Decision</strong></p>
                                        <p>The team makes its judgment decision by evaluating the evidence against the contract terms. The banking system follows blockchain escrow service records to transfer payment funds either for release to both parties or to refund the purchaser.</p>
