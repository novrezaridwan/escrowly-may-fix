                                        <h3>Secure Crypto Escrow Services for Brokers, Agents & Middlemen</h3>
                                        <p>The fast-digital economy depends heavily on brokers who link buyers with sellers in valuable transactions. Crypto payments introduce elevated risks to transactions and decrease the capability to establish trust between parties.</p>
                                        <p>That’s where Escrowly comes in. The completely crypto-native escrow platform Escrowly provides brokers with secure transactions, together with transparent and guaranteed safety for all participants who conduct business using only USDT and USDC.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Here’s how it works:</strong></p>
                                        <h3>Step 1: Set Up the Deal</h3>
                                        <p>By finding your way to your Escrowly dashboard, you can initiate an exchange. All you need to do is enter the following transaction details:</p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>1. Buyer and Seller Info</li>
                                            <li>2. Item or Service Description</li>
                                            <li>3. Agreed Terms</li>
                                            <li>4. Your Broker Commission</li>
                                            <li>5. Confidential Deal - Conceals Buyer and Seller emails for an enhanced transaction privacy</li>
                                        </ol>
                                        <p>The Escrowly.com platform develops a specific smart contract escrow, which establishes secure terms and funds distribution for every participant.</p>
                                        <h3>Step 2: Buyer Deposits Funds</h3>
                                        <p>At this stage, the buyer has to securely deposit USDT or USDC funds into the escrow wallet for crypto. Stablecoins maintain a constant value during transactions, which eliminates unexpected price changes during the process. Everyone maintains confidence in the transaction because the funds are locked down safely in decentralized escrow services.</p>
                                        <h3>Step 3: Seller Delivers, Broker Oversees</h3>
                                        <p>Once the security of the funds is confirmed, the seller executes the delivery of their goods or service completion. During the exchange, the broker has to verify that the transaction follows all stated terms. The control you maintain in escrow transactions prevails in every case, including escrow for car lease payments, escrow for real estate closings, and escrow for business acquisitions - all while your exposure remains minimal.</p>
                                        <h3>Step 4: Funds are Disbursed & Commission is Paid</h3>
                                        <p>Both the buyer and the seller confirm the transaction, or you, as the verified broker, verify the agreement for the contract to disburse payments to the seller and send your commission automatically. No chasing clients. No manual splits. Every commercial deal features automatic trust mechanisms.</p>

                                        <h3>Transparent to Buyers and Sellers</h3>
                                        <p>The Broker commission can be paid by the Buyer or Seller and are shown to both buyers and sellers and things are completely transparent to both buyers and sellers, we also have another option where broker selects "Confidential Transaction".</p>
                                        <h3>What is Confidential Transaction?</h3>
                                        <p>In a confidential transaction by Broker, the financial terms (purchase price, escrowly fee, and broker commission) are not displayed to the Buyer or Seller. The Broker commission can be paid by the Buyer, Seller, or can be split between the Buyer and Seller. Also, the Escrowly fee can be paid by the Buyer, Broker, or split 50/50 between the Buyer and Broker.</p>
                                        <h3>Commission Transparency and Smart Control</h3>
                                        <p>Brokers can securely receive commissions once deals close successfully. Thanks to escrow smart contracts crypto solutions, payments are automated and trustless—no delays, no reversals, no surprises. Our broker escrow setup is ideal for:</p>
