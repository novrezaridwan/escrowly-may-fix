                                <h3>The Problem with Luxury and Crypto</h3>
                                <p>Luxury buyers and sellers are increasingly turning to cryptocurrency. But crypto payments are irreversible, and in the world of rare collectibles, jewelry, and fine goods, the stakes are high.</p>
                                <p>Some common risks include:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Scams and fake listings</li>
                                    <li>Stolen goods</li>
                                    <li>Non-delivery after payment</li>
                                    <li>Chargeback fraud using centralized exchanges</li>
                                    <li>Buyers or sellers vanishing mid-transaction</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>Essentially, there is no room for mistakes. That is where Escrowly’s secure crypto escrow becomes the bridge of trust between anonymous buyers and reputable sellers.</p>

                                <h3>How Escrow for Luxury Items Works on Escrowly?</h3>
                                <p>Escrowly makes luxury transactions simple, even when buyers and sellers are continents apart. Here is how our crypto escrow platform works:</p>
                                <h6>1. Deal Initiation</h6>
                                <p>The buyer and seller agree on the item, price, inspection period, and shipping terms. This agreement can be managed directly or through a broker using Escrowly’s broker escrow service.</p>
                                <h6>2. Escrow Deposit</h6>
                                <p>The buyer sends USDT or USDC to Escrowly’s secure escrow wallet for crypto. These stablecoins ensure that the value doesn’t change during the transaction process.</p>
                                <h6>3. Item Shipment & Inspection</h6>
                                <p>The seller ships the item using an approved carrier with tracking and insurance. Once received, the buyer has an inspection period to authenticate the product.</p>
                                <h6>4. Funds Disbursement</h6>
                                <p>After the buyer confirms receipt and satisfaction, or the inspection period ends, funds are automatically released to the seller via our smart contract escrow system.</p>
                                <h3>Designed for Private Collectors, Sellers, and Brokers</h3>
                                <p>Whether you are a solo collector buying your next piece or a broker managing a multi-party deal, Escrowly gives you the tools to:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Set custom escrow terms</li>
                                    <li>Assign commissions for brokers</li>
                                    <li>Split or assign fees flexibly</li>
                                    <li>Monitor real-time progress through your dashboard</li>
                                    <li>Receive instant USDT or USDC payouts when deals close</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>We have designed Escrowly to work for individuals, businesses, and platforms that are looking for secure crypto transactions in the luxury market.</p>
                                <h3>Global, Fast & Fiat-Free</h3>
                                <p>Escrowly was designed for a borderless economy. With crypto, luxury items are traded between buyers and sellers in different countries daily. However, traditional escrow platforms rely on banks, credit checks, and fiat currency.</p>
                                <p>Escrowly changes that with:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Cross-border crypto escrow</li>
                                    <li>Instant on-chain payments</li>
                                    <li>No fiat delays, no wire transfer fees</li>
                                    <li>No intermediaries are slowing down your transaction</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>All you need is a crypto wallet and access to USDT or USDC.</p>

                                <p>When you are dealing with high-value transactions, it pays to play smart. Here are some expert best practices to make the most of Escrowly:</p>
                                <h6>1. Verify All Parties</h6>
                                <p>Before engaging in any luxury crypto deal, you should ensure the buyer, seller, or broker is reputable. Escrowly’s platform reduces risk, but it is still a good idea to vet your partners.</p>
                                <h6>2. Agree on Specific Terms</h6>
                                <p>You should lay out your expectations clearly:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Condition of the item</li>
                                    <li>Shipping method and carrier</li>
                                    <li>Inspection period duration</li>
                                    <li>Return/refund policies (if any)</li>
                                    <li>Fees and who pays them</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>These can be included in the custom terms section of the Escrowly agreement.</p>
                                <h6>3. Use Approved Carriers</h6>
                                <p>You must make sure to always ship high-value items via Escrowly-approved carriers with tracking, insurance, and delivery confirmation. It is the best way to back up your claims in case of disputes.</p>
                                <h6>4. Always Use USDT or USDC</h6>
                                <p>Escrowly doesn’t accept Bitcoin, Ethereum, or volatile altcoins. Using stablecoins ensures your luxury item isn’t subject to price swings or delays caused by network congestion.</p>
                                <h6>5. Stick to the Inspection Period</h6>
                                <p>Buyers should scrutinize items and confirm satisfaction within the agreed window. Escrowly releases funds automatically at the end of this period if no issues are reported.</p>
                                <h3>Use Case: Escrow for High-End Watch Sales</h3>
                                <p>Imagine a buyer in Singapore purchasing a $60,000 Patek Philippe from a seller in Paris. The buyer wants to pay in USDC, but neither side knows the other personally. With Escrowly:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>The buyer deposits USDC into escrow</li>
                                    <li>The seller ships the watch with insurance and tracking</li>
                                    <li>The buyer inspects it upon arrival</li>
                                    <li>Escrowly releases funds only after the buyer is satisfied</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>It is secure, fast, and effortless for both parties!</p>
                                <h3>Scale with Confidence Using the Escrowly API</h3>
