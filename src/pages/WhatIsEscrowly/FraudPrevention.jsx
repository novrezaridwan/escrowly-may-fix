                                        <h3>How to Identify and Prevent Fraud</h3>
                                        <p>Online fraud occurs frequently on websites and particularly affects crypto payment systems due to the inability to reverse transactions. One misstep can cost thousands. The methodology at Escrowly.com eliminates frequent cyber-attacks, among which are:</p>
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>1. Non-delivery of goods or services</li>
                                            <li>2. Payment reversal fraud</li>
                                            <li>3. Counterfeit or substandard products</li>
                                            <li>4. Manipulated contracts or terms</li>
                                        </ol>
                                        <blockquote>Blockchain escrow services, together with smart contract escrow functions at Escrowly.com, maintain complete fund control from any single entity. Our organization serves as a neutral intermediary that secures payments by implementing automatic verification systems and arbitration solutions as well as flexible inspection delays</blockquote>
                                        <h3>How Escrowly.com Prevents Fraud</h3>
                                        <p><strong>1. Funds Held in Escrow</strong></p>
                                        <p>Right after a buyer starts a transaction, their funds move into a Escrowly’s secure escrow wallet for crypto currencies such as USDT and USDC, which minimize price volatility. The funds remain out of reach for the seller until both delivery verification and customer approval occur.</p>
                                        <p><strong>2. Smart Contract Automation</strong></p>
                                        <p>Escrowly applies escrow smart contracts crypto functionality for automatic agreement implementation. These unalterable blockchain protocols confirm contractual conditions are fulfilled before adding funds to wallet operations so users avoid mistakes and scheming behavior.</p>
                                        <p><strong>3. Built-in Dispute Resolution</strong></p>
                                        <p>Our dispute resolution system provides objective reviews to help resolve errors that may occur. Parties present evidence to an expert team which quickly handles disputes with impartiality.</p>
                                        <p><strong>4. Verified Users & Activity Logs</strong></p>
                                        <p>Every user undergoes verification before participating, and all transactions carry timestamps for full traceability and accountability across dealership payments through escrow and service provider or freelancer escrow processes.</p>
